- Removed `UseWebRequest` parameter from `Invoke-CosmosDbReuest` function
  to refactor out the use of `Invoke-RestMethod`. This is because most
  Cosmos DB REST requests return additional header information that is
  lost if using `Invoke-RestMethod`. `Invoke-WebRequest` is used instead
  so that additional headers can always be retured - See [Issue #125](https://github.com/PlagueHO/CosmosDB/issues/125)

- Added integration tests for stored procedures.
- Added integration tests for triggers.

  of a function when a "Too Many Request" (error code 429) is recieved -
  See [Issue #87](https://github.com/PlagueHO/CosmosDB/issues/87)
- Added support for handling a back-off policy to the `Invoke-CosmosDbRequest`
  function.
